# Pass me the aux

This project hits the Spotify API to load the mini player of one of my favorite playlists that I've put together. Enjoy the tunes!

Note: Initial load times on the page can take 20 secondsâ€“1 minute. The free version of Render that I've deployed the app on has some restrictions, apologies.
